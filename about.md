### __Short bio__

Olivia Chen (オリビア　陳), is an assistant professor at the Institute of Advanced Sciences of Yokohama National University, Japan. Her current researches include superconducting electronics, extremely high energy-efficient computing, deep learning hardware accelerator and design automation for superconducting VLSI implementation.

She was a research associate at YNU, Yoshikawa Laboratory, Yokohama, Japan (2017), part-time lecturer at YNU, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama, Japan (2014-2017).

Dr. Chen received her PhD degree in Electronic Engineering from YNU, Yokohama, Japan (2017). She received her master's degree in Electronic Engineering from YNU, Yokohama, Japan (2014). 

She is a member of IEEE and ~~was a member of IEICE until she forgot to wire the membership fee~~, she just earned her IEICE membership back by wiring a lot of money.
